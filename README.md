# Collection of Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains notebooks that I created for learning purposes:


* **Clustering with K-means:** An introduction to the K-Means algorithm. I present the algorithm using sklearn, before implementing it from scratch. K-Means is then applied to a concrete problem.  


* **Pulsars Detection with HTRU2 Dataset:** The HTRU2 Pulsars dataset contains data about pulsars. I first use the dataset as a binary classification problem, and as an opportunity to try different classification algorithms and compare their performance. Then, I use the dataset for unsupervised learning tasks, namely by using a clustering method (K-Means) with PCA as a precursor step. 

* **Animals from the QuickDraw Dataset:** The QuickDraw dataset contains 50 millions of drawings collected by Google. I select 12 categories from the dataset (only animals) and train this dataset on a CNN.


* **Facial Keypoints Detection (Kaggle):** The data comes from a Kaggle competition. I train a CNN to recognize 15 keypoints on faces.
